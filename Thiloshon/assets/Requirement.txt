A shopping cart to sell products related to your sites� theme/ idea.

 There should be several categories of products and
    each category should have a page of its own. Ex. If you have chosen �Cricket� as the theme then you can have one page
    to sell sport items such as cricket bats and balls, another page to sell souvenirs such as shirts, key tags and another
    page to sell nutrition foods and drinks.
    There should at least be 3 different categories and each category should have
        at least 4 products to sell with a detail/ description for each product with the remaining stock quantity.

        For the products pages you need to consider the followings:
        ? Available balance for each item should be taken from the database

        ? Product details/ descriptions should be taken from the database as well.

 and after the order is placed the number of items should be modified accordingly.

The shopping cart needs to collect the following:
3
? Personal details
? Contact information (mobile no, email etc�)

When a user has finished choosing the items then
? An automatic bill for the products ordered should be prepared.
? Before proceeding it should force the user to fill-in some compulsory fields.
? When the 'place order' button is clicked, the user should get a message with the summary of the order.
? Every order needs to be saved on a database and for every order a unique ID should be generated for user to track the
    progress of the order at a later time.
? The background color of the page should change according to the total price of the bill and the unique ID should be
    displayed on this page.
A page should be there for the users to track the progress of the orders by entering the unique ID for the order and
    view the progress of the order with the details of the order.
